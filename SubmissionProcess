- Every application needs an App ID or application identifier.
- To submit an application to the App Store, you need to create an iOS provisioning profile for distribution. To create this provisioning profile, a distribution certificate needs to be created first. The process for creating a distribution certificate can be found here.
- Once an App ID and a distribution certificate has been created, you can create an iOS provisioning profile for distributing your application through the App Store.
- With the App ID, distribution certificate, and provisioning profile in place, you can configure your project's build settings in Xcode. A deployment target also needs to be set, which is the minimum version of the operating system that the application can run on.
- To prepare for the submission process, first you need to create your application in iTunes connect. Visit iTunes Connect and sign in with your iOS developer account to fill out the necessary form.
- After that has been completed you are now ready to upload your binary.
- To submit your application, you need to create an archive of your application. You can only create an archive by building your application on a physical device.
