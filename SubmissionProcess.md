Submitting an iOS Application to the App Store
=============================================

First you need to be enrolled in Apple's iOS Developer Program. You can enrol by visiting https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/

- Every application needs an App ID or application identifier.

- To submit an application to the App Store, you need to create an iOS provisioning profile for distribution. To create this provisioning profile, a distribution certificate needs to be created first. The process for creating a distribution certificate can be found at https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuideXcode4/CodeSigningYourApps/CodeSigningYourApps.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013500-CH23-SW1.

- Once an App ID and a distribution certificate has been created, you can create an iOS provisioning profile for distributing your application through the App Store.

- With the App ID, distribution certificate, and provisioning profile in place, you can configure your project's build settings in Xcode. A deployment target also needs to be set, which is the minimum version of the operating system that the application can run on.

- To prepare for the submission process, first you need to create your application in iTunes connect. Visit https://itunesconnect.apple.com and sign in with your iOS developer account to fill out the necessary form.

- After that has been completed you are now ready to upload your binary.

- To submit your application, you need to create an archive of your application. You can only create an archive by building your application on a physical device.
